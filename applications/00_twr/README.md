# Description

Two way ranging application. One device acts as a master, initiating TWR ranging after a BLINK from a slave device is received.

`uwb_monitor.py` is used to collect and store the data from a master node.
`uwb_getid.py` gets the device ID from all of the nodes and stores it into a file.

## BIN

Binaries from DUAL_MODE_TWR
DEBUGGING LOGs are on --> workaround for gibberish on UART
